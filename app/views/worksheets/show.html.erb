<h4>Working with stakeholders</h4>

<p>As you plan your actions, keep the stakeholders you've identified and their motivations in mind. Who could be an ally in change? Who is most threatened by the change you seek? What's the right way to approach each of them about change?</p>

<h4>The work of leadership</h4>

<h5>Your organization's capacity for adaptive work (antifragility):</h5>

<div class="antifragile_results_bar_container">
	<div class="antifragile_results_bar" id="<%= @red_result %>">Low</div>
	<div class="antifragile_results_bar" id="<%= @yellow_result %>">Average</div>
	<div class="antifragile_results_bar" id="<%= @green_result %>">High</div>
</div>

<%= render partial: @red_result if @red_result  %>
<%= render partial: @yellow_result if @yellow_result %>
<%= render partial: @green_result if @green_result %>


<p>No matter where you start or what your goal is, it is always best to tackle tough leadership challenges with allies. Find mentors, partners, and supporters where you can. Leading change is a process of managing conflict, and it will test your own personal capacity for these burdens; do not carry them alone.</p>

<h4>Experiment</h4>

<p>I have provided a few examples and ideas here, but they are by necessity very brief and not well tailored. The process of adaptive change in an organization is driven by the same mechanism as all other adaptation: experiments. Nature provides experiments through random mutation, but in our organizations we have the opportunity to proactively try things: new meeting formats, new policies, new values statements, new review processes and so on.</p>

<p>Crucially, experimentation works best if it is not localized. You do not have the answer, by definition: if you knew the answer, it wouldn't be an adaptive challenge and leadership would not be required! Instead, engage the organization at large to be creative. Bring awareness and attention to the problem and enable experimentation to find solutions that enable the organization to thrive.</p>

<p>More likely than not, someone, or some group, will have to suffer real loss. This is tough no matter the circumstance, but it is best handled when the loss is understood by everyone, not just those who lose, and when the need for the loss is fully understood by those who bear it.</p>
